## Hi there 👋 I'm Miguel Branco

I'm a developer, builder, and founder based in Geneva, Switzerland 🇨🇭 — originally from **Porto, Portugal** 🇵🇹, the land of sunshine and port wine 🍷.

I lead [RAW Labs](https://www.raw-labs.com), where we're reimagining how developers interact with data — with chat interfaces, structured prompts, and a killer SQL engine under the hood.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On
- 🧠 [**MXCP**](https://mxcp.dev/) – An open, declarative framework for building and running AI tools & APIs
- 🐥 [**RAW**](https://raw-labs.com/) – A platform to turn SQL and YAML into production-ready APIs over data
- 🐘 PostgreSQL extensions & FDWs
- ⚙️ Deep integrations with **DuckDB**, **DBT**, and **Python**

### 👨‍💻 Tech I Use Regularly
- Scala, Python, C, Rust, TypeScript, Bash
- PostgreSQL, DuckDB, gRPC, Protobuf
- Kubernetes, GitHub Actions
- macOS (with a flavor for CLI minimalist setups)
- .. and lots of [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) and [Replit](https://replit.com/), lately.

### 💼 Work Experience

- **CTO & Co-Founder – RAW Labs**
_Mar 2015 – Present | Lausanne, Switzerland_

Bringing the next-gen data infrastructure to market: a SQL engine built for declarative AI, modern data APIs, and real-time analytics — all over raw, remote, and nested data.

- **Researcher in Database Systems – EPFL**
_Oct 2010 – Feb 2015 | Lausanne, Switzerland_

Co-creator of RAW, a novel database architecture for high-performance querying of raw data. Researcher in the Data-Intensive Applications and Systems Laboratory.

- **Software Engineer – CERN**
_May 2003 – Mar 2009 | Geneva, Switzerland_

Software Engineer for the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Led the architecture and development of the ATLAS Distributed Data Management system, which handled over 15 petabytes of scientific data.

### 🎓 Education

- **PhD, Computer Science (2004 – 2009), University of Southampton**
Researched large-scale distributed systems and managed petabyte-scale scientific datasets in grid environments.

- **Engineer, Software Engineering (1998 – 2003), Universidade do Porto**

### 🧠 Interests & Side Projects
- Building smart developer platforms with zero-boilerplate
- Pushing the limits of local analytics
- Automating everything (when worth it)
- (Occasionally hacking on game dev)

### 🏠 IRL
- I have two kids, a garden full of millet, and a knack for squeezing performance out of both software (and one, day, small sports cars).
- You might find me writing a PostgreSQL planner hook one day and coaching youth badminton the next.
